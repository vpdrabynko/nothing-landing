# Features overview

A Pixel Perfect Layout is adaptive and responsive as well as cross-browser compatible. It works correctly on all screen sizes (mobile, tablet and desktop versions). Is is implemented using the mobile-first approach.

The code is valid HTML5 and CSS3. In order to decrease user load and avoid code duplication, styles are implemented using Sass (SCSS) including mixins.
BEM methodology is used for naming classes. This naming convention makes the code more readable and understandable, helps to avoid naming conflicts and makes the code easier to maintain and reuse.

User interaction is implemented using hover effects. The page is interactive and has a smooth animation.

Semantic and meta tags are used. SEO optimization is done. Accessibility is improved. The page is optimized for loading speed.

# Reflections

The main challenge of this project was to implement design without JavaScript and to make it responsive. I had to use more advanced CSS features like flexbox, grid, media queries, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements along with Sass (SCSS) features like mixins etc.
